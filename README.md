# Progressive Web Apps @cmda-minor-web · 2019-2020

🚀In order to keep the minor train rolling, we meet online each day.   
[Check the sheet for your group, meeting time and invitation link to the online meeting: PWA 1920 Remote Meetings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OqiGIB3U2esUSfW9WsMsny_30qlhf9o7CWBYrmzaZwI/edit?usp=sharing)  
Use headphones during the meeting to avoid sound noise 🎧 

In this course we will convert the client side web application previously made at the OBA into a server side rendered application. We also add functionalities based on the Service Worker and turn the application into a Progressive Web App. Ultimately we are going to implement a series of optimisations to improve the performance of the application.  

## Learning goals
- _You understand the difference between client side and server side rendering and you can apply server side rendering
in your application_
- _You understand how a Service Worker works and you can implement it in your application._
- _You understand how the critical render path works and how you can optimize it for a better runtime and / or perceived performance._
