Minor Web Development - Progressive Web Apps

## Intention

This week we convert our OBA or WAFS application to a Progressive Web App

## Method

12 hours have been scheduled to work independently on this week's assignments this week. Try to plan your work wisely! In the meantime, progress is monitored in standup meetings and classroom meetings. At the end of the week you will be tested on theoretical knowledge and on the understanding of the code that you write according to the assignments.

## Exercises
1. Prepare for video meeting
2. Convert your app into a Progressive Web App
3. Implement a Service Worker

### Exercise 1: Prepare for video meeting

#### Instructions
ðŸš€In order to keep the minor train rolling, we meet online each day.   
[Check the sheet for your group, meeting time and invitation link to the online meeting: PWA 1920 Remote Meetings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OqiGIB3U2esUSfW9WsMsny_30qlhf9o7CWBYrmzaZwI/edit?usp=sharing)  
Use headphones during the meeting to avoid sound noise ðŸŽ§   
Use Chrome for video meetings!

#### Preparations
To prepare for the video meeting, think of two or three things you want to talk about. These can be things that you find difficult or that you need help with. 

[Check the feedback sheet for possible issues](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V5-mwJhezxCrywKhy0e9J99zcI2VGZRuYxSDJoQ9LPg/edit?usp=sharing) - add these issues to your forked repository.

### Exercise 2: Convert your app into a Progressive Web App

Make an installable version of your app, making it feel more app-like.

### Exercise 3: Implement a Service Worker

Consider how you want to implement the Service Worker in your OBA app. Create a job story for this. Make sure that you at least cache and serve a number of static assets with the Worker. Also provide feedback to the user about the online / offline state.

Include your job story in the README.md
